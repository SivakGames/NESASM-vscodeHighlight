# 6502 README

Provides syntax highlighting for Nintasm (an NES 6502 assembler) in VS Code.  Based on the TextMate syntax.

- Note: Originally this was intended for NESASM and, to some extent, this will also work with NESASM projects.

## Features

Highlights all the 6502 instructions, 6502 number types (i.e. binary, hex), Nintasm-specific directives, functions, and labels for labeled operations.

## Requirements

Target files should end with either a `.6502` or `.asm` extension.

## Custom Installation

This is not on the Marketplace.  On Windows, simply move these files (including the parent folder) to the following folder:

```text
\Users\##USER_PROFILE##\.vscode\extensions
```

## Extension Settings

N/A

## Known Issues

None *currently*.
